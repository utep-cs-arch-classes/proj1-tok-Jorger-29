# Project 1: Tokenizer

## Instructions:

- To start the program, just use "make main" and it will be ready to run.
- To use the history, just use the '!' followed by the id of the story. (Ex. !3)
- To view all the saved histories use the character '~' to see all available.

# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.
